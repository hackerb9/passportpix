"Good" images for a US Passport appear to be based on eye position

Left eye: 5/12 of the way from the left edge
Right eye: 7/12 of the way from the left edge
Both eyes: 7/12 of the way from the bottom edge

The distance between the eyes is 2/12th of the image length, so
we can use that for scaling the video capture.
